# Ogurets for Jetbrains IDE's
<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin brings full support for Ogurets to IntelliJ IDEA - piggybacking on Jetbrains existing Cucumber plugins.
It should work in any variant that has Cucumber (including Android Studio) and at least Dart installed,
and if it detects Flutter, it will also support Flutter FlutterDriver tests.
